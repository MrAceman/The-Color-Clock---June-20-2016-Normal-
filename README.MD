## Color Clock - Normal Mode

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created June 20th, 2016.  The goal was to create a working clock that also had the background color change per second.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to work on use of window.setInterval, Date (and associated property identifiers), conversion of numbers to hex, and applying JS changes to the background property using the DOM.
